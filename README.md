# EnergyConsumption

I am not an expert. This is just a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle to explore and to practice Data Science. It comes from "Countries CO2 Emission and more...".

- The Dataset looks at the CO2_Emissions, Energy_Consumption, Energy_Production and much more from countries all around the globe. It covers a span of 40 years from 1980 to 2019. The analysis I conducted where done on some of the countries of North America. I looked into the the amount of CO2 released into our atmosphere from Mexico, the United States of America and Canada as well as the amount Energy Consumed. 

- Then I combined all the countries in North America to see how much CO2 has been released into the atmosphere from the North American continent.

- Lastly I looked at the total emissions from the globe as a whole.
